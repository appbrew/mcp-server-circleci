  description: `
    This tool retrieves test metadata for a CircleCI job.

    PRIORITY USE CASE:
    - When asked "are tests passing in CI?" or similar questions about test status
    - When asked to "fix failed tests in CI" or help with CI test failures
    - Use this tool to check if tests are passing in CircleCI and identify failed tests
    
    Common use cases:
    - Get test metadata for a specific job
    - Get test metadata for all jobs in a project
    - Get test metadata for a specific branch
    - Get test metadata for a specific pipeline
    - Get test metadata for a specific workflow
    - Get test metadata for a specific job

    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
    1. Truncation Handling (HIGHEST PRIORITY):
       - ALWAYS check for <MCPTruncationWarning> in the output
       - When present, you MUST start your response with:
         "WARNING: The test results have been truncated. Only showing the most recent entries. Some test data may not be visible."
       - Only proceed with test result analysis after acknowledging the truncation

    2. Test Result Filtering:
       - Use filterByTestsResult parameter to filter test results:
         * filterByTestsResult: 'failure' - Show only failed tests
         * filterByTestsResult: 'success' - Show only successful tests
       - When looking for failed tests, ALWAYS set filterByTestsResult to 'failure'
       - When checking if tests are passing, set filterByTestsResult to 'success'

    Input options (EXACTLY ONE of these THREE options must be used):

    ${option1DescriptionBranchRequired}

    Option 2 - Direct URL (provide ONE of these):
    - projectURL: The URL of the CircleCI job in any of these formats:
      * Job URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123/workflows/abc-def/jobs/789
      * Workflow URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123/workflows/abc-def
      * Pipeline URL: https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/gh/organization/project/123

    Option 3 - Project Detection (ALL of these must be provided together):
    - workspaceRoot: The absolute path to the workspace root
    - gitRemoteURL: The URL of the git remote repository
    - branch: The name of the current branch
    
    For simple test status checks (e.g., "are tests passing in CI?") or fixing failed tests, prefer Option 1 with a recent pipeline URL if available.

    Additional Requirements:
    - Never call this tool with incomplete parameters
    - If using Option 1, make sure to extract the projectSlug exactly as provided by listFollowedProjects and include the branch parameter
    - If using Option 2, the URL MUST be provided by the user - do not attempt to construct or guess URLs
    - If using Option 3, ALL THREE parameters (workspaceRoot, gitRemoteURL, branch) must be provided
    - If none of the options can be fully satisfied, ask the user for the missing information before making the tool call
